if we take the gcd of the difference of aray element
the for all i a[i]%gcd will be same

and if want to get 2 distinct a[i]%x for all
i then it would be x = 2*gcd



product of two same prime is composite but  two distinct prime is not strongly composite.
But product of three distinct prime is strongly composite.
strongly composte -> prime divisor<=composite divisor
