Chicken McNugget Theorem : 
  For any two relatively prime (co-prime) positive integers m,n. The greatest integer that cannot be written in the form am+bn for nonnegative integers a,b is mn-m-n.
  A consequence of the theorem is that there are exactly (m-1)*(n-1)/2 positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form am+bn.
